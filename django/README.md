# Django

A python based web framework that is very popular (used in mozilla, open stack and etc.)

## My opinions

Altough I did not even scratch the full potential of django in my 1 hour testing time nor am I a professional, here is my 2 cents:

- I really like the language used since python is a intutive language, and one that I really like
- Easy url management
- Definately not the fastest, but what it makes up would be the development and coding time which are it's real pluses. Also this aint much of an intensive task that you will notice the millisecond difference.

Overall for me I would use it with nextjs frontend which will for me atleast give a score of 9/10. It is my current favorite framework.
